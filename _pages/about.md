I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Oxford, working with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) on non-reversible jump algorithms (see News). I will start as an Assistant Professor of Actuarial Science in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Université de Montréal in December, 2019.

My background in actuarial science comes from undergraduate studies in that field. After the bachelor degree, I did a master and a Ph.D. in Statistics. During the latter, I developed interests for Bayesian robustness against outliers and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. I more precisely developed methodology for obtaining robust model/variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression, along with efficient algorithms for achieving those tasks. 

My research has been so far more on the theoretical/methodological side. My plan for the next years is to apply the tools I developed in actuarial science, and to introduce sophisticated methods of interest for actuaries. In particular, I want to develop an automatic data analysis procedure in which the models are robust and trained through a full and exact Bayesian analysis (see Project for more details).  

Starting from December, I will thus be looking for students with a strong background in either: theoretical statistics (mainly probability and analysis), applied statistics and actuarial science, and informatics (the plan is also to develop R packages for a user-friendly and efficient implementation of the methods). There exist multiple funding opportunities (see, e.g., [NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/) and [FRQNT](http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/accueil)). It even possible for non-Canadians scholarships. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested.
