I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Oxford, working with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/). I will start as an Assistant Professor of Actuarial Science in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Université de Montréal in December, 2019.

My background in actuarial science comes from undergraduate studies in that field. After the bachelor degree, I did a master and a Ph.D. in Statistics. During the latter, I developed interests for Bayesian robustness against outliers and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. I more precisely developed methodology for obtaining robust model/variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression, along with efficient algorithms for achieving those tasks. I recently worked on the introduction of nonreversible jump samplers for nested
models (see News).
