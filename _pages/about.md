I am an assistant professor of actuarial science in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/) at Université de Montréal. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Oxford, working with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) on non-reversible jump algorithms. 

My experience and interest in actuarial science began with undergraduate studies in this field. While doing the bachelor's degree, I also fulfilled all the requirements for obtaining the Associate designation from the [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org). After that, I completed a master's and Ph.D. in Statistics. During the graduate studies, I developed an interest for Bayesian robustness against outliers and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. I more precisely introduced methodology for obtaining robust model/variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression, along with efficient algorithms for achieving these tasks. 

My research has so far been more on the theoretical/methodological side. My objective for the next years is to apply the tools I developed in actuarial science, and to introduce sophisticated methods of interest for actuaries. In particular, I want to develop an automatic data analysis procedure in which the models are robust and trained through a full and exact Bayesian analysis (see [Project](https://philippegagnonphd.github.io/website/cv/) for more details).  

**Advertisement:** I am looking for students with a strong background in either: theoretical statistics (mainly probability and analysis), applied statistics and actuarial science, and computer science (the plan is also to develop R packages for a user-friendly and efficient implementation of the methods). There exist multiple funding opportunities (see, e.g., [NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/) and [FRQNT](http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/accueil)). It is even possible for non-Canadians to apply for FRQNT scholarships. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. *Recruiting will be done according to  Université de Montréal's Equity, Diversity and Inclusion policy.*
